Contributed to a software engineering project with the goal of creating a tool that evaluates the level of contributions for each member within a GitHub repository. I contributed to this project by implementing features that displayed performance metrics of each member onto visual representations such as graphs with the use of Streamlit. This tool is able to generate an overall score for each user based on various metrics such as: teamwork performance, lines added/removed, and the amount of pull requests which were created.
